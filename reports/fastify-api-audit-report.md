Tiers:
- public   → No authentication required
- user     → Individual user operations

However, several business-critical features for the modeling industry (model profiles, casting, payments) need immediate attention to achieve feature parity with the documented specification.

**Overall API Completeness: 75%**
**Infrastructure Quality: 9/10**
**Feature Implementation: 7/10**
