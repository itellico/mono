And 55+ other resource categories including accounts, users, billing, compliance, etc.

## Duplicate Permissions Note

There are some intentional duplicate permissions for different scopes:
- `payments.*` (2 occurrences - global and tenant scopes)
- `users.*` (2 occurrences - global and tenant scopes)
- Similar patterns for other resources

These are not errors but represent different permission scopes in the RBAC system.

## Conclusion

The itellico Mono database is fully configured and ready for production use. All security, multi-tenancy, and RBAC requirements have been successfully implemented.
