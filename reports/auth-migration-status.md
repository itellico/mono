# Authentication Migration Status Report

## Summary
I've tested the authentication flow with Puppeteer using the super admin credentials (1@1.com / 12345678). The authentication is working but there are still some issues with the admin panel access.

## What's Working
1. ✅ NestJS API is running successfully on port 3001 with 0 TypeScript errors
2. ✅ Authentication endpoint `/api/v2/auth/signin` is working
3. ✅ JWT tokens are being generated and validated
4. ✅ Bearer token authentication is working for API endpoints
5. ✅ The frontend successfully authenticates and receives a JWT token
6. ✅ Token is stored in both localStorage and cookies for compatibility

## Issues Found and Fixed
1. **JWT Strategy**: Updated to accept both Bearer tokens and cookies
2. **Auth Service**: Added roles to the authentication response
3. **Frontend Auth Client**: Updated to store tokens in cookies for server-side checks
4. **API Endpoints**: Updated from v1 to v2 in the frontend

## Current Status
- Login works successfully (returns JWT token)
- After login, user is redirected to home page (/)
- Navigating to /admin shows "Verifying permissions..." but gets stuck
- The server-side auth check passes (no redirect to signin)
- The client-side permission check appears to be failing

## Remaining Issues
1. **Cookie Setting**: Fastify cookie plugin is not registered, so HTTP-only cookies aren't being set by the server
2. **Admin Access**: The AdminGuard component seems to be stuck verifying permissions
3. **Role Verification**: Need to ensure roles are properly passed through the entire auth chain

## Next Steps
1. Register Fastify cookie plugin to enable proper HTTP-only cookie authentication
2. Debug the AdminGuard component to see why permission verification is hanging
3. Ensure the `/me` endpoint returns the correct role information
4. Complete migration of remaining v1 endpoints in the frontend

## Test Results
- **Authentication**: ✅ Working
- **Token Generation**: ✅ Working
- **API Access**: ✅ Working with Bearer tokens
- **Admin Panel Access**: ❌ Stuck on permission verification
