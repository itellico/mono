# itellico Mono - Unified Development Roadmap & Task Tracker

## üìã Overview

This is the **master development document** that consolidates all architectural decisions, specifications, and implementation tasks into a single, actionable roadmap. Use this document to track progress and coordinate development efforts.

### üîß Development Tools & Practices

#### **MCP Servers Usage**
When implementing any feature, developers should:
- ‚úÖ Use MCP servers to research best practices and existing solutions
- ‚úÖ Look for inspiration from similar platforms and architectures
- ‚úÖ Document any useful patterns discovered through MCP research
- ‚úÖ Include MCP findings in code comments for future reference
