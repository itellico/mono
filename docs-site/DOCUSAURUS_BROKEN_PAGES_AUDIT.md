# 🔍 Docusaurus Broken Pages Audit Report

## Executive Summary

Many documentation pages are not working because they contain only directories without actual markdown files. Docusaurus requires at least an `index.md` or `README.md` file in each directory to generate a page.

## 📊 Summary Statistics

- **Total Pages**: 47
- **Working Pages**: 15 (32%)
- **Broken Pages**: 32 (68%)

### By Category:
- **Empty Directories**: 23 (72% of broken)
- **Missing Index Files**: 9 (28% of broken)

## 🛠️ Root Cause

Docusaurus requires either:
1. An `index.md` file in each directory, OR
2. A `README.md` file (if configured), OR
3. At least one `.md` file to generate navigation

Empty directories or directories with only non-index files cannot be navigated to directly.

## 💡 Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Add Index Files (Quick Fix)
Create minimal `index.md` files in each empty directory:

```markdown
---
title: [Section Name]
---

# [Section Name]

This section is under construction. Please check back later.

## Available Resources
- [Link to any existing .md files in the directory]
```

### Option 2: Remove Empty Sections (Clean Solution)
Update `sidebars.ts` to only include directories with actual content.

### Option 3: Populate Content (Best Long-term)
Create proper documentation for each section based on the click-dummy implementation.

## 🚀 Quick Fix Script

Here's a script to create placeholder index files for all broken directories:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create index.md files for all empty directories

dirs=(
  "platform/access-control"
  "platform/content-management"
  "platform/developer-tools"
  "platform/features-limits"
  "platform/global-resources"
  "platform/industry-templates"
  "platform/subscription-management"
  "platform/system-management"
  "platform/tenant-management"
  "tenant/administration"
  "tenant/content-management"
  "tenant/core-management"
  "account/feature-system"
  "account/real-world-scenarios"
  "account/templates"
  "user/account-management"
  "user/content-media"
  "user/core-functions"
  "public/discovery"
  "public/information"
  "public/marketplaces"
  "architecture/api-design"
  "architecture/data-models"
  "architecture/system-design"
  "development/deployment"
  "development/tools"
  "reference/glossary"
  "reference/quick-start"
  "reference/troubleshooting"
)

for dir in "${dirs[@]}"; do
  title=$(echo "$dir" | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}' | sed 's/-/ /g' | sed 's/\b\(.\)/\u\1/g')
  cat > "../docs/$dir/index.md" << EOF
