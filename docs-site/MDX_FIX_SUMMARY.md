# MDX Compilation Error Fix Summary

## Problem
MDX (Markdown + JSX) was interpreting certain patterns in markdown files as JSX syntax, causing compilation failures. The main issue was `<` followed by numbers (e.g., `<10ms`) being interpreted as JSX tags.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Immediate Fixes Applied
Fixed the following files with MDX compilation errors:
- `docs/database/performance-monitoring-guide.md` - Fixed `<10ms` and `<10GB` patterns
- `docs/database/nestjs-service-update-guide.md` - Fixed `<100ms` and comment spacing
- `docs/architecture/nestjs-migration/fastify-to-nestjs-migration-guide.md` - Fixed `<50ms` and `<100ms`

### 2. Scripts Created

#### a) Simple Fixer (`scripts/fix-mdx-issues-simple.js`)
- Quick script to fix known problem files
- Focuses on specific patterns causing immediate build failures

#### b) Comprehensive Fixer (`scripts/fix-mdx-comprehensive.js`)
- Full-featured MDX issue scanner and fixer
- Handles multiple patterns:
  - `<number` → `&lt;number`
  - `>number` → `&gt;number`
  - Comparison operators (`x < y` → `x &lt; y`)
  - Comment spacing (`//5min` → `// 5 min`)
  - Standalone `<` or `>` symbols
- Respects code blocks and inline code
- Supports dry-run mode for preview
- Provides detailed statistics

### 3. NPM Scripts Added
```json
{
  "mdx:check": "node scripts/fix-mdx-comprehensive.js --dry-run ../docs",
  "mdx:fix": "node scripts/fix-mdx-comprehensive.js ../docs",
  "prebuild": "npm run mdx:check"
}
```

Now you can:
- `pnpm mdx:check` - Check for MDX issues without fixing
- `pnpm mdx:fix` - Automatically fix all MDX issues
- Build process automatically checks for issues before building

### 4. Documentation Created
Created `docs/development/mdx-best-practices.md` with:
- Explanation of common MDX issues
- Prevention tips
- Quick reference guide
- Safe alternatives for problematic patterns

## Results
✅ All MDX compilation errors fixed
✅ Build now completes successfully
✅ Automated tools prevent future issues
✅ Documentation helps developers avoid problems

## Usage Going Forward

1. **Before committing markdown changes:**
   ```bash
   pnpm mdx:check
   ```

2. **To fix issues automatically:**
   ```bash
   pnpm mdx:fix
   ```

3. **Build will automatically check:**
   The prebuild script runs MDX check before building

4. **When writing docs:**
   - Use `&lt;` instead of `<` for less than
   - Use `&gt;` instead of `>` for greater than
   - Or wrap in backticks: `` `<10ms` ``
