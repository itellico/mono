# Performance Architecture

Performance optimization is critical for the itellico Mono platform. This section covers caching strategies, React patterns, and storage optimization techniques.

## Overview

The itellico Mono platform employs a multi-layered performance strategy:

- **3-Layer Caching**: Browser, CDN, and application-level caching
- **Smart State Management**: Optimized React patterns and storage strategies
- **Database Optimization**: Query optimization and connection pooling
- **Storage Strategy**: Efficient data access patterns

## Performance Guides

### Caching Strategy
- [Caching Strategy](./caching-strategy) - Comprehensive caching implementation
- [Three Layer Caching](./three-layer-caching) - Browser, CDN, and application caching

### React Optimization
- [React Patterns](./react-patterns) - Component optimization and performance patterns

### Storage Optimization
- [Storage Strategy](./storage-strategy) - Data storage best practices and decision matrix

## Key Performance Metrics

- **Page Load Time**: < 2 seconds (target)
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms (average)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 90% (target)
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3 seconds

## Performance Monitoring

The platform includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Track actual user experience
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Automated performance testing
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Server-side performance tracking
- **Core Web Vitals**: Google's user experience metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Measure First**: Always measure before optimizing
2. **Cache Aggressively**: Use all three cache layers appropriately
3. **Optimize Bundles**: Code splitting and lazy loading
4. **Database Efficiency**: Optimize queries and use proper indexing
5. **CDN Utilization**: Leverage edge caching for static assets
