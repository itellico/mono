# Development Workflows

This section covers the development workflows and processes used in the itellico Mono project.

## Overview

The itellico Mono project follows a structured development workflow that emphasizes:

- **Research-First Development**: Always understand before implementing
- **Intelligent Auto-Coding**: Leveraging AI assistance effectively
- **Best Practices**: Following established patterns and conventions
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and code review

## Workflow Documentation

### Complete Workflow
- [Complete Workflow](./complete-workflow) - End-to-end development process from planning to deployment

### Intelligent Auto-Coding
- [Intelligent Auto-Coding](./intelligent-auto-coding) - AI-assisted development patterns and best practices

## Development Phases

### 1. Research Phase
- Review existing documentation
- Understand requirements and context
- Check for existing implementations
- Identify patterns and dependencies

### 2. Planning Phase
- Break down complex tasks
- Define implementation steps
- Identify potential challenges
- Plan testing strategy

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Follow established patterns
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging

### 4. Testing Phase
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Performance testing

### 5. Deployment Phase
- Code review
- Staging deployment
- Production deployment
- Monitoring and validation

## Best Practices

1. **Follow the Research-First Rule**: Never implement without understanding
2. **Use Established Patterns**: Leverage existing code patterns and conventions
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all functionality is properly tested
4. **Document Changes**: Keep documentation in sync with code
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track metrics and optimize as needed

## Tools and Automation

- **AI Assistance**: Claude Code for intelligent development support
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for code quality
- **Testing**: Jest, Playwright, and custom testing utilities
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability and alerting
