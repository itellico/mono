# Testing

Comprehensive testing is essential for the itellico Mono platform. This section covers testing methodologies, frameworks, and best practices.

## Overview

The itellico Mono platform employs a multi-layered testing strategy:

- **Unit Testing**: Individual component and function testing
- **Integration Testing**: API and service integration testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflow testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability and penetration testing

## Testing Documentation

### Testing Methodology
- [Testing Methodology](./methodology) - Comprehensive testing approach and principles

### Types and Coverage
- [Types and Coverage](./types-and-coverage) - Different testing types and coverage requirements

## Testing Frameworks

### Frontend Testing
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: React component testing
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **Storybook**: Component documentation and testing

### Backend Testing
- **Jest**: Unit and integration testing
- **Supertest**: HTTP API testing
- **Prisma Testing**: Database testing utilities
- **Load Testing**: Performance and stress testing

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid
```

```

### Testing Levels

1. **Unit Tests (70%)**
   - Fast execution
   - Isolated testing
   - High coverage
   - Quick feedback

2. **Integration Tests (20%)**
   - API endpoint testing
   - Database interactions
   - Service communications
   - Component integration

3. **End-to-End Tests (10%)**
   - User journey testing
   - Critical path validation
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Performance validation

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```
/tests
  /unit          # Unit tests
  /integration   # Integration tests
  /e2e          # End-to-end tests
  /fixtures     # Test data and fixtures
  /utils        # Testing utilities
```

### Naming Conventions
- Unit tests: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `*.integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `*.e2e.test.ts`
- Test fixtures: `*.fixture.ts`

## Test Coverage

### Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Critical paths covered
- **E2E Tests**: Main user journeys covered

### Coverage Reports
- Automated coverage reporting
- Branch coverage analysis
- Code coverage badges
- Coverage trend tracking

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint code analysis
- Prettier code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks

### Testing Best Practices
1. **Write Tests First**: TDD approach when possible
2. **Keep Tests Simple**: One assertion per test
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Clear test descriptions
4. **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolated testing
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Cover error scenarios

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
- Pull request validation
- Automated test execution
- Coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarking

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Coverage thresholds met
- No linting errors
- Performance benchmarks met
