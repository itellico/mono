### üîÑ In Progress

1. **Schema Alignment** (70%)
   - Auth service updated ‚úÖ
   - Tenant service updated ‚úÖ
   - Platform service updated ‚úÖ
   - User service partially updated
   - Account service pending

### ‚ùå Remaining Tasks

1. **Final Migration Steps**
   - Complete schema alignment for remaining services
   - Run performance benchmarks
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Execute Fastify cleanup
   - Deploy to production

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Complete Schema Alignment

```bash
cd apps/api-nest

# Fix remaining TypeScript errors
pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Update remaining services to work with Prisma schema
# - Update user service methods
# - Update account service methods
# - Fix any remaining type mismatches
```

### Step 2: Performance Validation

```bash
# Run the performance benchmark
cd apps/api-nest
pnpm tsx src/benchmark/load-test.ts

# Expected output:
# - Target: 40,000 req/sec
# - Actual: Should exceed target on health endpoints
```

### Step 3: Staging Deployment

```bash
# Build the NestJS application
cd apps/api-nest
pnpm build

# Build Docker image
docker build -t nestjs-api:staging .

# Deploy to staging
kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/

# Run smoke tests
pnpm test:e2e:staging
```

### Step 4: Fastify Cleanup

```bash
# Validate NestJS is fully functional
cd ../..
./scripts/migration/validate-and-cleanup-fastify.sh

# Review validation report
cat fastify-cleanup-validation-report.md

# Execute cleanup (with backup)
./scripts/migration/validate-and-cleanup-fastify.sh --cleanup
```

### Step 5: Production Deployment

```bash
# Build production image
cd apps/api-nest
docker build -t nestjs-api:production .

# Tag and push to registry
docker tag nestjs-api:production your-registry/nestjs-api:v2.0.0
docker push your-registry/nestjs-api:v2.0.0

# Deploy to production
kubectl apply -f k8s/production/

# Monitor deployment
kubectl rollout status deployment/nestjs-api -n mono-production
```

## Post-Migration Checklist

- [ ] All endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Performance meets 40K req/sec target
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Team trained on NestJS patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Fastify codebase removed
- [ ] Git repositories cleaned up

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Restore Fastify from backup
   cd migration-backup/fastify-[timestamp]
   ./restore-fastify.sh
   ```

2. **Kubernetes Rollback**
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/nestjs-api -n mono-production
   ```

3. **DNS/Load Balancer**
   - Switch traffic back to Fastify endpoints
   - Update service mesh configuration

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**
   - API response time &lt; 50ms (p95)
   - Throughput &gt; 40K req/sec
   - Error rate &lt; 0.1%

2. **Reliability**
   - Uptime &gt; 99.9%
   - Zero data loss
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Build time &lt; 2 minutes
   - Test execution &lt; 5 minutes
   - Clear error messages
   - Comprehensive documentation
