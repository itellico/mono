# Account Feature System

The Feature System represents a revolutionary approach to account management, eliminating rigid account types in favor of a flexible, feature-based model. Enable only what you need, when you need it.

## Overview

Our unified account system provides:

- **Single Account Type**: All accounts start the same
- **Flexible Features**: Mix and match capabilities
- **Pay-As-You-Grow**: Enable features as needed
- **Custom Combinations**: Create your unique setup
- **Instant Switching**: Change features anytime

## Core Concept

### Traditional vs. Feature-Based

**Traditional Approach (Old):**
- Fixed account types (Agency, Professional, Client)
- Rigid feature sets
- Difficult to change
- Over/under-featured accounts

**Feature-Based Approach (New):**
- One account type for all
- Choose individual features
- Change anytime
- Perfect fit for your needs

interface FeatureCategory {
