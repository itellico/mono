# Translation Management System

## Overview

Comprehensive multi-language translation system with LLM-powered automation and human quality assurance for global creative industries.

### Key Features

- **LLM-Powered Auto-Translation**: Context-aware translation with multiple provider support
- **Human Review Workflow**: Quality assurance with translation approval process
- **Multi-Level Configuration**: Platform → Tenant → User language settings
- **Quality Scoring**: Confidence metrics and translation quality tracking
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live translation status and progress tracking
- **Version Control**: Translation history and rollback capabilities

## System Architecture

### Translation Hierarchy
- **Platform Level**: Available languages, default LLM providers, global templates
- **Tenant Level**: Approved languages, industry-specific terms, custom LLM configuration
- **User Level**: Language preferences, quality settings, auto-translation consent
- **Content Level**: Source text extraction, translation keys, context metadata

### Translation Pipeline
1. Developer adds new translation key
2. System extracts source strings
3. LLM provides auto-translation with confidence score
4. High confidence (\\&gt;90%): Auto-approve and deploy
5. Medium confidence (60-90%): Queue for human review
6. Low confidence (\\&lt;60%): Flag for manual translation
7. Deploy approved translations to CDN

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
Comprehensive schema supporting multi-tenant translation management with quality tracking.

**Core Tables**:
- `supported_languages` - Platform-level language configuration
- `tenant_language_settings` - Tenant-specific language preferences
- `translation_strings` - Source strings with context and metadata
- `translations` - Translation entries with confidence scores
- `translation_quality_metrics` - Quality assessment data
- `tenant_llm_translation_config` - LLM provider configuration

**Schema**: See `prisma/schema.prisma` for complete table definitions

### Service Layer
Comprehensive translation service with LLM integration and quality assessment.

**Core Features**:
- Source string extraction from codebase using regex patterns
- Multi-provider LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Context-aware translation prompts
- Human review workflow with approval process
- Automated quality scoring and metrics
- JSON file generation for deployment
- CDN integration for distribution

**Implementation**: See `src/lib/services/translation.service.ts`

### Frontend Integration
React hooks for translation consumption and management with cache optimization.

**Translation Hook**: Variable interpolation, namespace support, lazy loading
**Management Hook**: Admin interface for string management, auto-translation, approval workflow
**Cache Management**: TanStack Query integration with proper invalidation

**Implementation**: See `src/hooks/useTranslation.ts` and `src/hooks/useTranslationManagement.ts`

## Admin Interface

### Translation Management Dashboard
Comprehensive dashboard for translation string management with filtering and status tracking.

**Features**:
- Language and status filtering
- Translation statistics overview
- Auto-translation triggers
- Review workflow interface
- Quality metrics display

### Translation String Card
Individual translation entry management with inline editing and approval workflow.

**Features**:
- Multi-language display
- Confidence score indicators
- Inline editing capabilities
- Status badge system
- Review notes and context

**Components**: See `src/components/admin/translation/`

## LLM Provider Integration

### Multi-Provider Support
Abstract provider interface supporting multiple LLM services with unified API.

**Supported Providers**:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google Translate API
- Custom provider implementations

**Features**:
- Context-aware translation prompts
- Confidence scoring algorithms
- Quality assessment capabilities
- Provider failover and fallback
- Usage tracking and cost optimization

**Implementation**: See `src/lib/services/llm/providers/`

## Quality Assurance & Metrics

### Translation Quality Dashboard
Comprehensive quality tracking with provider performance analytics.

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Overall quality scores across all translations
- Auto-translation success rates and confidence levels
- Human review queue status and processing times
- Quality breakdown by language and provider
- Cost efficiency and usage analytics

**Component**: See `src/components/admin/translation/QualityDashboard.tsx`

## Deployment & CDN Integration

### Translation File Generation
Automated deployment service for generating and distributing translation files.

**Features**:
- JSON file generation with nested key structures
- Multi-namespace organization (common, admin, etc.)
- CDN upload and cache invalidation
- Deployment status tracking and rollback capabilities
- Tenant-isolated file structure

**Implementation**: See `src/lib/services/translation-deployment.service.ts`
