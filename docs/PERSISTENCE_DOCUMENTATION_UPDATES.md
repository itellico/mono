# Docker Persistence Documentation Updates

## Summary

This document summarizes all documentation updates made to reflect the new Docker persistence architecture across the itellico Mono project.

## Updated Files

### 1. Core Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md** - Updated project structure to include docker/ and docker-data/ directories

### 2. Architecture Documentation
- **docs/architecture/performance/storage-strategy.md** - Already includes comprehensive storage strategy (no updates needed)

### 3. Development Documentation

#### Getting Started
- **docs/development/getting-started/developer-guide.md**
  - Added Docker as recommended prerequisite
  - Updated setup instructions to use docker-compose.persistent.yml
  - Added persistent storage architecture section
  - Updated production deployment with persistent volumes

#### Reference
- **docs/reference/quick-start/index.md**
  - Updated prerequisites to recommend Docker
  - Modified Docker quick start section with persistence
  - Added persistent storage structure diagram
  - Updated environment configuration for Docker defaults

#### Tools
- **docs/development/tools/index.md**
  - Added comprehensive persistent Docker setup section
  - Updated Docker scripts with persistence support
  - Added data management scripts section

### 4. Deployment Documentation

#### Main Deployment Guide
- **docs/development/deployment/index.md**
  - Updated Docker Compose setup with persistent storage
  - Added persistent storage architecture diagram
  - Updated development scripts for persistence
  - Added references to persistence documentation

#### Docker Management
- **docs/development/deployment/docker/index.md**
  - Added persistent storage architecture overview
  - Updated quick commands for persistent setup
  - Revised best practices for bind mounts
  - Added references to persistence guides

### 5. Service Documentation
- **docs/kanboard-setup.md**
  - Updated configuration to reflect PostgreSQL storage
  - Corrected access URL and credentials
  - Updated backup/restore procedures
  - Added Docker persistence note

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
All documentation now reflects the dual-directory approach:
```
docker/         # Configuration files (in Git)
docker-data/    # Runtime data (NOT in Git)
```

### 2. Docker Commands
Updated all Docker commands to use the persistent overlay:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.persistent.yml up -d
```

### 3. Service URLs
Corrected service URLs to use actual IP address:
- Kanboard: http://192.168.178.94:4041
- Grafana: http://192.168.178.94:5005
- etc.

### 4. Best Practices
Emphasized:
- Use of bind mounts over named volumes
- Separation of config and data
- Regular backups with provided scripts
- Never committing docker-data/ to Git

### 5. References
Added cross-references to:
- /docs/DOCKER_PERSISTENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md
- /docs/DOCKER_VOLUMES_GUIDE.md

## Verification

To verify all documentation is accurate:
1. Check that all service URLs work
2. Confirm docker-data/ directory structure exists
3. Test backup and restore scripts
4. Verify persistence across container restarts

## Next Steps

1. Review all updated documentation for accuracy
2. Test all commands and procedures
3. Update any remaining documentation that references old Docker setup
4. Consider adding persistence information to API documentation
